# Coding Challenge 3 - Coding Refactor

## Password Generator
This code produces a randomly generated password. The user is prompted to select between 8 and 128 characters, and whether or not to include uppercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols in their password. The Javascript of this website adds several different arrays corresponding to lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols respectively and produces a randomly generated password with a for loop. This for loop will loop however many times the user has selected, between 8 and 128.
